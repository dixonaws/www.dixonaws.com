I'm a Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services, based in MÃ¼nchen. My interests are in all things technology, but especially cloud computing,
rapid prototyping with DevOps and CI/CD concepts, IoT, connected vehicles, and Amazon Alexa. In my off time I like to be on my bike, in search of the
best road route or mountain bike trail.
